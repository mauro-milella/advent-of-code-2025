# advent-of-code-2025
My Lua solutions for the 2025 Advent of Code.
I am taking this opportunity to learn a new language.

If, for any reason, you want to reproduce my code, browse the `src` folder and select the folder corresponding to a specific day; then, copy and paste your personal `input.txt`.

You can find a skeleton of generic solution in the `src/example` folder.
Moreover, `src/utils.lua` contains a bunch of generic utilites, as well the resources to which I have referred for writing them.

Note that in this year, 12 puzzles are provided instead of the canonical 25.

Have fun!
