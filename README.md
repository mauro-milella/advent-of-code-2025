My Lua solutions for the 2025 Advent of Code.
I am taking this opportunity to learn a new language.

## Instructions

If you want to reproduce my code, browse the `src` folder and select the folder corresponding to a specific day; before running `lua solution<n>.lua`, remember to copy and paste your personal `input.txt` in the same folder.

You can find a skeleton of generic solution in the `src/example` folder.

Moreover, `src/utils.lua` contains a bunch of generic utilites, as well the resources to which I have referred for writing them.

The logic specific to a certain problem, may live on its own (e.g., the [metatable and metamethods](https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html) of the circular array implementation in `src/padlock`, needed for solving the day 1 problem).

Note that in this year, 12 puzzles are provided instead of the canonical 25.

Have fun!
